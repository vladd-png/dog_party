This is a webpage devoted to all things dog. The original design of the website comes from a static image. The following were directions required by the webpage.
**Please Include the Following**
1. Build functionality to allow a user to type a dog name in the input field and then, when the user clicks the button, have that dog name replace the text Some Dogs in the main A Site About Some Dogs header and clear out the input field.
2. Make your Dog Party site mobile. 
3. Add functionality to each of the buttons in each column. When the user clicks on the button, it should hide the content in that specific column (still having the picture and button be displayed). When the user clicks the button again, the text should display once more.
3.1 add a nice animation to this to give a better transition
4. Add a tooltip to each of the elements in the navigation bar. When a user hovers over one of them, a tool tip should appear giving more information as to what that page is about.
5. Add another input and textarea to the form that can update the text in each column. The input should either be a dropdown or radio/checkboxes to specify which columnâ€™s text is being updated.

**This webpage aims to accomplish four out of five goals.**
1. Enter a *name* in the 'Name this Dog' input field to update the title **A Site About Some Dogs**.
1. The Nav bar at the top notifies you of choice with a hover tool.
1. When clicking any of the three bottom buttons, the correlating paragraph of text will hide. A second click will bring it back into view.
1. At the bottom of the page another input box allows you to manually update the information about the above articles.
